This project entails monitoring animal movements in the wild to aid in predicting natural disasters. Animal movements have been analysed heavily and there is a correlation between animal movement behaviour before a natural calamity strikes. However, most of this analysis is done in hindsight. By keeping an eye on the behaviour of animals local to an area,anomalies in their behaviour and movement can act as a fairly reliable warning of an upcoming natrual calamity. This inital warning could be used to pre-emptively notify authorities to monitor the concerned area closely and even evacuate the citizens in that area in time. This would give enough time to the authorities to act appropriately in anticipation of the disaster.
The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model using general animal movement data collected over the years to build a reliable background of usual animal movements in an area so that any out of the ordinary behaviour can be recognised quickly and can be used as an indicator to predict a natural disaster.
